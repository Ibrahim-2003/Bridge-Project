# Bridge Project
 
In this project, I examined a simple truss bridge and its ability to support the weight of cars driving over it. A bridge can be thought of as a network of fibers. These fibers can be made of iron or steel, but as far as a mathematician is concerned, we need only consider where these fibers are relative to one another, which fibers connect to which other fibers, etc.
